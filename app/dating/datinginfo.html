        <p><img src="./../dating tips glazen.jpg" alt="drinking glases" width="250" height="300"></p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>My favorite Restaurant: De Hof. Arnhemseweg 3, 3927 EE Renswoude. > The restaurant is very well informed
            about gluten-free food and takes cross-contamination into account. You can just choose from the menu and
            then they will see if they can make it gluten-free. The food is super delicious. If you want to go here, I
            do advice you to maken a reservation.</li>
          <li>Go to a movie after dinner</li>
          <li>Bison Bowling Utrecht. Mariaplaats 13A, 3511 LJ Utrecht. > Guests who eat gluten-free will receive a
            letter at the start of the dinner about which products in the buffet contain gluten and which do not. You
            can choose about a lot of things like gluten-free soup, gluten-free sandwiches, gluten-free fries,
            gluten-free sauces, various gluten-free salads, meat and fish. They can even make a seperate table to grill.
            You can even play bowling, if you both like to do that.</li>
          <li>Play tourist in your hometown. When was the last time you took advantage of the things everyone always
            wants to see when they visit? Probably the last time you had out-of-town guests, that's when. Take an
            afternoon or an evening and hit up your local landmarks or must-see attractions like you're seeing them with
            fresh eyes.</li>
          <li>Make a fun new recipe together. Even if you both not much into cooking, trying out a new dish can result
            in lots of laughs. Not to mention, you get to eat the results at home or go on a picnic. If it's nice
            outside, there's nothing more romantic than packing up some al fresco food and bev, spreading it on a
            blanket and enjoying the great outdoors.</li>
          <li>Take a hike. Something about exploring nature with your main squeeze really gets the heart going in other
            ways, if you know what we mean.</li>
          <li>Hit the beach. Sun, sand, surf and lots of skin. Come up with a better afternoon. We dare you.</li>
          <li>Play a board game. Drag out the classics or try a brand new one, for a healthy dose of competition. Toss
            in a friendly wager to spice things up a little.</li>
          <li>Throw a casino night. If they call you Lady Luck, see if your partner can roll snake eyes and win your
            heart. That, or play cards with that week's chore list on the line.</li>
          <li>Build a campfire. Ignite the flames of passion in a Smoky-approved way by gathering around a campfire in
            your backyard. If your municipality doesn't allow fires, huddle by the fireplace instead or even make
            s'mores in the microwave.</li>
          <li>Play hide 'n seek. It's not just for kids anymore.</li>
          <li>Take a dance class. Even (or especially!) if you have two left feet, taking a dance class can make a
            unique date. You'll be the talk of the dance floor at the next wedding or party when you bust a move.</li>
          <li>Volunteer together. Sign up to serve at a soup kitchen, a clothing drive or other local initiative to make
            a difference in your community and see how hot your honey looks when helping others.</li>
          <li>Visit the zoo or aquarium. Come on, even fish are cute. Show your sensitive side and squee over some new
            fuzzy or finned friends.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>If you are a jealous type you might want to skip this! A swingers club is an entertainment venue where
            couples can meet and perform sexual acts. Most couples clubs are designed for varied entertainment. You can
            goe out "normally". Dancing, eating, drinking, meeting friends, getting to know new friends, but also
            experiencing eroticism. For some visiters, the visit is therefor not purely about sex, but more about going
            out in an atmosphere or more openness and with more like minded people when it comes to eroticism and sex.
            Examples of swingers clubs: Amourette (Maarssen UT), Partyplayers (Lelystad FL), Devils and Angels (Susteren
            LB), De Zaar (Venlo LB), Kasteel Waterloo (Beesel LB), Fun4Two (Moordrecht ZH), De Showboat (Zaandijk NH)
          </li>
          <li>Playing toys, if you know what i mean examples to buy your toys are: at Easytoys or sextoyland and many
            other sites. look it up online or see it visual at the erotic shop.</li>
          <li>Lingerie is a musthave. But also some events do have a dresscode where you can only wear the next
            materials: lacquer, leather, latex, datex, neoprene, metal, feathers. Always check the site of the event for
            the dresscode.</li>
